## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

You might not need this action, because GitHub natively supports deleting merged branches. However, you can configure exactly which branches to delete using this action. It also works well for GitHub Free accounts that don't support protected branches.

### Inputs

#### `branches`

Glob rules for names of branches to delete, defaults to `!master, !develop`

### Environment variables

#### `GITHUB_TOKEN` (required)

GitHub token to delete branches: `GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`

### Example

```yaml
name: Merge PRs
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - closed
      - edited
      - reopened
jobs:
